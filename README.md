# frauDetection
#PROJECT SUMMARY

Machine learning model training as part of Mini project 3 while studying Data Science and AI at Institute of Data (Singapore).



Context: 

Commercial crimes such as frauds and scams have been on the rise. 
The increase in such cases has pushed the crime rate in Singapore to a ten-year high!
Just last week, on Sep 5, 2023, a housewife loses $37k in bank savings while trying to buy thunder tea rice online.
Are we still able to trust bank to safeguard our hard-earned monies against fraudulent transactions?

Machine learning has been the hot topic and known for its capability to analyze vast amounts of data, detect patterns, and identify anomalies in real-time.
So, can AI algorithm assist banks to identify and prevent fraudulent activities with greater accuracy and speed? 



Objective:

1. Obtain insights from dataset relevant to fraud detection
2. Evaluate machine learning model performance (LR,RF,SVM,XGBoost,Stacking Ensemble)


Steps to reproduce the code: 

Refer requirement.txt for libraries and environment setup needed

Refer data folder for datasets

Refer code folder for codes

Refer output folder for model (pickle file)
